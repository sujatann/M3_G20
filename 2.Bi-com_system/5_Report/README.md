# 1)About the BiCom System
## 1.1)Description:
This BiCom system is the extention of the unidirectional RKE to bidirectional RKE system. Here the bi-directional communication takes place in between the keyfob and the car. As we have seen the unidirectional in Remote Keyless Entry(RKE), now in BiCom system we will witness bi-directionaL. Information from keyfob to car viceversa. The status of the car will also be displayed on the keyfob by LED or display.


# 2)Features:
It shall display door satus of car for Four User Button Clicks.
It shall display alarm satus of car Two User Button Clicks.
It shall display window satus of car for one User Button Click.
It shall display battery information of car for Three User Button Clicks.

# 3)Requirements:
2.1 High Level Requirements:
ID	High Level Requirements
HLR1	System shall display Alarm status of the car
HLR2	system shall display Display status of the car
HLR3	System shall display Battery status of the car

# 4)5 W's 1 H

## Who :
Driver - The one who drives the car.
## What :
Thing - We are operating everything through BiCom.
## When :
Time - Whenever people are travelling.
## Where :
place - Anywhere in the locality up to a certain distance.
## Why :
Reason - To control their car easily and safely.
## How :
Steps - Just using RKE.

# 5)SWOT ANALYSIS:
## Strengths:
No need of human interaction with car Status with different features is provided. "Easy usage of features with a user press button.
## Weaknesses:
Limited Usage Range Less security to our system Interrupts or Timers would be good instead of delay so system works faster.
## Opportunities:
Wide scope in field of automobiles Cost Efficient Car features are tremendous which increases car value.
## Threats:
Less accurate timing We should wait until completion of a task to run an other task.
