## 1.1 ABSTRACT.
Nowadays, we have some difficulties in obtaining the distance that we want to measure. Even though, measuring tape is an easy option, but this kind of tool will have a limitation of manual error.. Before this, engineers have produced a range finder module but in the end, they find out the module have many disadvantages like limitation for distance, different result for different coloured obstacles, and need a calibration for every time before starts using it. Manual distance measuring is always done at the expense of human error. Precise and fix measurement of low range distance, is the main objective for this project. This device can measure distance in the range of 0.5m to 4m with the accuracy of1cm.This project is used to measure the distance by using ultrasonic sensors. It works by transmitting ultrasonic waves at 40 kHz. Then, the transducers will measure the amount of time taken for a pulse of sound travel to a particular surfaces and return as the reflected echo. After that, the circuit that have been programmed with AT mega microcontroller will calculate the distance based on the speed of sound at 25Â°C which an ambient temperature and also the time taken. The distance then will be display on a LCD module.

## 1.2 INTRODUCTION.

Ultrasonic sensors are great tools to measure distance and detect objects without any actual contact with the physical world. It is used in several applications, like in measuring liquid level, checking proximity and even more popularly in automobiles to assist in self-parking or anti-collision systems.This is an efficient way to measure small distances precisely. In this project, we have used the HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor with microcontroller or can also be interfaced with an arduino to determine the distance of an obstacle from the sensor. The basic principle of ultrasonic distance measurement is based on ECHO. When sound waves are transmitted in the environment then waves return back to the origin as ECHO after striking on the obstacle.
